# Overview
Noja is a high level programming language implemented as a learning exercise. Still, it aims to be a non-trivial example of how a language may be built. 

The use-cases of Noja are the same as Python since their abstraction level is comparable. The syntax is more similar to the C-family of languages though (curly brackets to denote scope).

## A Noja program
A Noja program is a sequence of statements separated by semi-colons (with some exceptions). The statements can be o various kinds: 
* expressions
* function definitions
* if-else branches
* while loops
* do-while loops
* compound statements
* `break` jumps
* `return` statements

(You may note that there is no import statement! This is because the ability to import other files is exposed through a built-in function.)

If not in string literals, whitespace doesn't matter.

Comments starts with `#` and end with the line.
